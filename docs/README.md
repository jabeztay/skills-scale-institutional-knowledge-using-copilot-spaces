# OctoAcme Project Management — Overview

OctoAcme follows a staged, decision-gated lifecycle that moves work from idea to production: Initiation (validate the problem, capture a Project One-pager and stakeholder list), Planning (kickoff, prioritized backlog, estimates, Definition of Done, and a release/milestone map), Execution (build, test, review, iterate), Release (deploy, verify, announce), and Close/Retrospective (capture learnings and convert them into backlog action items). Work moves from initiation to planning only after success metrics are defined, stakeholders agree on priority, and team capacity is confirmed.

Day-to-day delivery uses a lightweight project board and a small-PR, CI-driven workflow. Teams track work using columns (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done) and use a standard backlog-item template with acceptance criteria and estimates. Pull requests are kept small when possible, reference the related issue and acceptance criteria, run CI (tests and lint) before review, and follow team-defined approval rules. Blockers escalate through a three-level path (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor) to ensure timely triage.

Roles and communications are explicit: Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog, Project Managers coordinate delivery and communications, Developers implement and test, QA validates acceptance, and Stakeholders provide inputs and approvals. Regular cadences include daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, PM–PdM alignment meetings, and monthly stakeholder updates. Risks and dependencies are tracked in a simple Risk Register and reviewed weekly; templates and escalation paths standardize routine and incident communications.

Quality assurance and release practices emphasize automation and observability with unit and integration tests, end-to-end smoke checks for critical flows, security scanning in CI, and manual QA when needed. Releases require passing CI, release notes, and documented rollback plans; deployment checklists and an incident/rollback playbook guide safe rollouts. Retrospectives produce 2–3 prioritized action items that are added to the backlog with owners and success criteria to drive continuous improvement.
