# OctoAcme â€” Release & Deployment Guide

## Purpose
Standardize how OctoAcme releases features to production to reduce risk and improve observability.

## Role Ownership

Clear role ownership ensures accountability throughout the release process:

- **Release Manager**: Coordinates overall release process, manages deployment execution, and ensures rollback procedures are ready
- **QA Lead**: Provides testing sign-off, validates smoke tests on staging, and confirms quality gates are met
- **Technical Writer**: Ensures release notes and documentation are complete and published with the release
- **Project Manager**: Aligns release timeline with project milestones and communicates status to stakeholders
- **Developers**: Prepare code for release, assist with deployment verification, and support incident response if needed

For detailed checklists per role, see [OctoAcme Role Checklists](octoacme-role-checklists.md).
